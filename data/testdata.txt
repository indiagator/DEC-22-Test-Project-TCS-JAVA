In the Java programming language, all source code is first written in plain text files ending with thejava extension.
Those source files are then compiled into .class files by the javac compiler. A .class file doesnot contain code that
isnative to your processor; it instead contains bytecodes â€” the machine language of theJava Virtual Machine1 (Java VM).
Thejava launcher tool then runs your application with an instance of the JavaVirtual Machine.
